Quick Start for building bitquarkd in Unix/Linux
-----------------------------------
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev
sudo apt-get install libdb4.8++-dev
sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev

cd src/
make -f makefile.unix "USE_UPNP=-"

First, make sure that the required packages for Qt4 development of your distribution are installed, these are

for Debian and Ubuntu  <= 11.10

apt-get install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev build-essential libboost-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev libssl-dev libdb4.8++-dev

for Ubuntu >= 12.04

apt-get install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev build-essential libboost-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev libssl-dev libdb++-dev libminiupnpc-dev

then execute the following:

qmake "USE_UPNP=-"
make

An executable named `bitquark-qt` will be built.
Alternatively, install `Qt Creator`_ and open the `bitquark-qt.pro` file.

If you get an error related to "leveldb' files, you can download the pre-compiled files from here http://bitquark.info/downloads/leveldb_files.zip
Just extract these two files and place them in the /src/leveldb/ folder.
